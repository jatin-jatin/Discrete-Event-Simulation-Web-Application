# Discrete-Event-Simulation-Web-Application

## Project Description
This project simulates the following charateristics of a Web application in  a closed loop

![Web-server-system-diagram](https://github.com/jatin-jatin/Discrete-Event-Simulation-Web-Application/blob/main/pictures/Web-Server-System.png)
* Multi-Core Server Machine
* Multi-threaded Web Server
* Thread-per task model - with buffering for requests
* Round-robin scheduling
* Request time-outs with retries
* Users in closed loop with think time
* Execution Time and timeout - options for distribution
## Discrete Event Simulation

## Performance Metrics
* Avg. Response Time vs number of users
* Throughput, Goodput, Badput vs number of users
* Request Drop rate vs number of users
* Avg. core utilization vs number of users
